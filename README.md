An owl who never sleeps
Hi everybody! I am a fifth-year architecture student, and I am from Hanoi, Vietnam
I am a funky, crazy, and quiet person depending on the situations. When the weather is nice, especially in the fall, when the leaves start changing color, and the wind starts to blowing bringing a cool and fresh breeze, I love walking under the rows of trees with my eyes closed and my hands hang out to feel and smell the wind.
